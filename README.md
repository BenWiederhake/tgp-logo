# New logo for telegram-purple chat

I was bored and made an ugly logo.  Are you a designer?  Do you know
how to combine these images in the intended way?  Do you have a tool
that can actually do transparency porperly without you going insane?
Have a minute? Getting annoyed by these questions?  Please make a
better image and help us? :D

## Source files

The following two files were used:
- Pidgin: [PNG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Pidgin.svg/2000px-Pidgin.svg.png), [License (GPL)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pidgin.svg)
- Telegram: [PNG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Telegram_logo.svg/2000px-Telegram_logo.svg.png), [License (Public Domain, but Trademarked)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Telegram_logo.svg)

I combined them using [mtpaint](http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/), a
really crappy tool that works quite well, but is just unwieldy.

Have fun and `mtpaint layers.txt` to your hearts content!  Pull
requests welcome.
