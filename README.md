# New logo for telegram-purple chat

I was bored and made an ugly logo.  Are you a designer?  Do you know
how to combine these images in the intended way?  Do you have a tool
that can actually do transparency porperly without you going insane?
Have a minute? Getting annoyed by these questions?  Please make a
better image and help us? :D

## Source files

The following two files were used: [Pidgin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Pidgin.svg/2000px-Pidgin.svg.png), [Telegram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Telegram_logo.svg/2000px-Telegram_logo.svg.png)

I combined them using [mtpaint], a really crappy tool that works quite
well, but is just unwieldy.  Have fun and `mtpaint layers.txt`
